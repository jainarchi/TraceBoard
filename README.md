### 🔗 [View Live Demo](https://trace-board.vercel.app/)

**TraceBoard** is a streamlined task management application designed to help you organize your workflow efficiently. Built with a clean UI and distinct columns for **Todo**, **In Progress**, and **Done**, it allows for seamless task tracking with persistent data storage.


## ✨ Features

* **Drag & Drop Interface:** Smoothly move tasks between columns (Todo ➔ Progress ➔ Done) using native HTML5 Drag and Drop API.
* **Create, Edit, & Delete:** Full CRUD capabilities. You can add new tasks, edit details in-place without losing the column position, and delete completed tasks.
* **Local Storage Persistence:** Your tasks are saved automatically to the browser's Local Storage. Refreshing the page won't lose your data.
* **Dynamic Task Counters:** Real-time task counting for each column to visualize workload.
* **Clean & Responsive UI:** A distraction-free interface focused on productivity.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **HTML5:** Structure and Semantic markup.
* **CSS3:** Styling, Flexbox/Grid for layout.
* **Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+):** DOM manipulation, Event Listeners, and Logic (No external frameworks used).
